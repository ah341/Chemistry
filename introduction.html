<P> <font size="6">
 pH is a measure of how acidic or basic a substance is.
 It takes a numerical value between 0 and 14 that measures the relative amount of free hydrogen and hydroxyl ions in water.
 Water having more hydrogen ion concentration than hydroxyl is acidic.</P>
 <P>On the other hand, water having more hydroxyl ion concentration than hydrogen is basic or alkaline
In medical science, having the proper pH in the blood and other body fluids is essential for the body to function correctly.
 In agriculture, pH is used to determine the soil’s acidity and adjust the acidic content to make it suitable for growing specific crops.</P>
<P>The pH of water determines a substance’s solubility and biological availability of nutrients such as phosphorus, nitrogen, and carbon.
 pH also indicates the amount of heavy metals such as iron, lead, and copper dissolved in water. For example, pH determines how much and what form of phosphorous can be utilized by aquatic life.
 The solubility of heavy metals determines their toxicity.
 Metals are more toxic at lower pH because they have high solubility.</P>

<H1> Hypothesis</H1>

<br>
<br>
<P>If different household substances are added to a substance, 
<br>then each will cause a measurable change in the pH level
<br> depending on whether the substance is an acid or a base.
